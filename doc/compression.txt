Compression types:
Pack: Run length encoding
Compress: LZW
Squash: 13 bit LZW
Crunch: 12 bit LZW followed by Pack
Squeeze: Run length encoding followed by Huffman coding


LZW types:
UNIX_COMPRESS: Standard Unix compress, with 3 byte header
SQUASH: 13 bit compress, no header
ZOO: 13 bit compress, no header, first code is CLEAR
PACKDIR: Same as zoo, but user must supply the number of bits
CRUNCH: If bits not specified, then first byte is the bit size
COMPRESS: Same as crunch
